\large \textbf{Variance of Linear Probability model}\\
Bias term is inconsequential to this derivation. Omitting the bias we can express LPM as the following:
\begin{align*}
	y_{i}=\beta x_{i} + \epsilon_{i}\text{ where}\\
	\begin{cases}
		y = 1: p(x_{i})\\
		y = 0: 1-p(x_{i})\\
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Note that expectation of $\epsilon_{i}$ is 0, because of the properties of OLS. Therefore:
\begin{align*}
	Var(\epsilon_{i}) &=E[(\epsilon_{i} - E(\epsilon_{i}))^2]\\
					& = E[\epsilon_{i}^2]
\end{align*}
Given the fact that y can only take two values, $\epsilon_{i}$ also can only take two values:
\begin{align*}
	\begin{cases}
		1 - \beta x_{i}: p(x_{i})\\
		0 - \beta x_{i}: 1-p(x_{i})\\
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}

Using this fact and definition of the expectation:
\begin{align*}
	Var(\epsilon_{i}) & = E[\epsilon_{i}^2]\\
					  & = (1 - \beta x_{i})^2 p(x_{i}) + (0 - \beta x_{i})^2(1-p(x_{i}))
\end{align*}

Now, using the fact that $ E[y|x_{i}] = p(x_{i})$, derived in the lecture, we can write:
