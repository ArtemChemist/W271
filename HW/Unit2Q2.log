I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

! Missing $ inserted.

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

l.46 	
      
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

! Display math should end with $$.

                   \tex_par:D

The `$' that I just saw supposedly matches a previous `$$'.
So I shall assume that you typed `$$' both times.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
l.51 	p(x_{i}) &
                 = E[y_{j}|x_{i}]\\\
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
l.52 			 &
           = E[\beta jjjj6bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark

simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
